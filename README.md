Various finite element implementations for composite laminate plates in MatLab for teaching and small research projects

Self-contained  light weight implementation of finite element analysis of rectangular composite laminate using various shear deformation theories (inc. Resiner-Mindlin Plate, Refine Zig-Zag Plate theory).

Visualisation is done using open-source code paraview (https://www.paraview.org) - mesh and solution variables in matlab are converted to .vtk format using script matlab2vtk (in 'include/postProcessing')
